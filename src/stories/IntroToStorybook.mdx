# Introduction

Repo: [https://github.com/shalanah/storybook-playground](https://github.com/shalanah/storybook-playground)

## Pros

- Clean-room environment for building components
- Instils good component design / hygiene
- Fast! Easier to test complex parts of your app
- Shared documentation
- Easy to share (publish a static version to the web üåê)

## Live examples

- Drei
- Something else

## Cons

- Initial setup time (+ keep up time)
- Learning curve for new users
- Best with bigger teams or complex projects
- May over complicate simple components

## IMO

Add Storybook if your team is excited about Storybook.

There is overhead but in professional long-term projects or projects with bespoke or complex UIs, the benefits outweigh the costs.

Start small only ie: presentational new components - you don't even need to mandate it!

## Agenda

- File structure
- Create stories for your components
  - Addons
  - Easily create new stories
  - Docs
  - Fullscreen layout
- Creating tests
